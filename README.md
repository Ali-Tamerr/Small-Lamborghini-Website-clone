My first Front-End React project totaly made by me with my new favourite IDE "Cursor". 
CSS, JS & JSX are used only in this project and no Javascript or CSS Library Used. 
This website is a small clone to AutoMobili Lamborghini Official website.

Here's what i did in it:
- Made good transitions that's being done when the element or the object is in Page's View, No matter whatever the page's size is.
- Treated with Routes and useNavigate so the available buttons like "Take a Look" and "View car" can show you what it suppposed to show without reloading the page!
- Made an active search button where you can look for one of the cars I've put to the project's local database (4 cars only).
- Made a local translation that translates almost every word from Arabic to English quickly without reloading the page.
- And of course, The whole website is responsive to all the screens up to the Mobile medium screen size.


Total time taken â‰ˆ 12 days.
